<br>this repository is an example of source material for creating a hydra (https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) interactive nft minted on hicetnunc (https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/) with additional p5js elements as well as audio. hydra created by olivia jack (https://twitter.com/_ojack_)
<br>best practice is to include all js libraries as well as the required index.html and thumbnail. style.css appears to be unnecessary but is included in this repo for experimentation purposes.
<br>
<br>this repo is experimental and a work in progress. use at your own risk. :)

<br>follow the guidelines provided by https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/wiki/Interactive-OBJKTs. this is an elaboration on the html method.
